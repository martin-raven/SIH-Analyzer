9|" TITLE: Time Series Machine Learning based Prediction Model to achieve consistent Product Moisture in manufacturing

BACKGROUND: Achieving consistency in product quality is one of the key objectives in a manufacturing process. The product quality in a process is affected by both, process and environmental parameters. In case of a hygroscopic organic product, moisture plays a vital role in determining the end product quality. In the case of this problem it is crucial to maintain the end product moisture level within a narrow band for superior product quality. To achieve the same, online control of various process parameters is required in manufacturing.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The manufacturing process of this product has a drying step which is controlled to get the end product moisture within limits. However, post drying, the retention time and conditions in further process steps impact the final product moisture. The incoming material loses moisture in the drying process. The dryer process parameters are controlled through a PID loop with short and long term levers. Post drying, the product is stored in a conditioned environment and is transferred for manufacture as per requirement. Product interacts with the surrounding environment while residing in the storage area and the manufacturing process. Due to these interactions, the product moisture changes from the desired value of 13.5+/-0.3%. Building a time series machine learning model to predict Ex- Dryer moisture set point will help to achieve Ex-Packing moisture within 13.5+/-0.3% with maximum accuracy.

PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a Time series Neural Network (LSTM/GRU) model to predict Dryer set point in order to achieve Ex-packer moisture within 13.5+/-0.3


PROJECT DELIVERABLES:
1. To develop a time series machine learning model to predict Dryer moisture set point in order to achieve Ex-packer moisture within 13.5+/-0.3 %
a. To counter the variation of the ambient & storage conditions, the target variable (Ex-Dryer Moisture) is changed to bring the final product moisture (var13) in the spec range of 13.5+/-0.3%.
2. Desired Accuracy Level (For Training and Model Learning): 
96% accuracy has been achieved. Further improvement is desired to achieve accuracy of 98+% levels
3. Desired Accuracy Level (For Testing):
The built model should be tested on data points which have Ex-packer moisture (var13) within 13.5+/-0.3 %, predicting the target dryer set point value as close to actual set point value with an accuracy of 99%+.

10|" TITLE: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing for Online Inspection of Packed Cases

1.BACKGROUND: Leaves of a crop are threshed and are packed into 200 Kg cases. 10% of these packed cases are later inspected for conformity to the master case approved by the customer in terms of Color, Ripeness and Uniformity. The quality inspection processes are manually operated and rely on the judgmental experience of the experts. The judgment is heavily driven by personal, business and environmental factors and is highly subjective.


2.PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Inspection is a crucial activity to ensure customer satisfaction. Although it doesn’t eliminate the defects in the product, it helps identify the defective products before they are dispatched to the customer. The limitations with the existing inspection process is multi-fold.

• While Customer expects all the cases to be inspected, due to space and man-power constraints, today, the business is able to achieve only 10% inspection. 
• As the inspection process happens one day after the cases are processed, due to limitations with Expert availability, real-time corrective actions in the factory in case of deviations in product quality gets difficult
• Due to human involvement in the visual inspection, there is inherent subjectivity involved in the process

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT: To automate in real-time, the packed case inspection using Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques and enhancing the objectivity of the inspection process. 

4.	PROJECT DELIVERABLES:
(a) To develop 3 separate algorithms which imitate Color, Ripeness and Uniformity inspection while keeping the processing time for each of the algorithms under 1 minute each
(b) The developed Algorithms to be generic of the grade type for all Color, Ripeness and Uniformity dimensions
(c) To identify patterns for Color, Ripeness & Uniformity inspection, if any by understanding the way Algorithm is functioning

11|" TITLE: Packaging format and design optimizer for packaged food products

1. BACKGROUND: The packaging format design is currently based on trial and error for most of the packaged food products. The packaging format decides the damage any food product will undergo, especially during transit and handling. Especially for biscuits, product breakage is a prime concern, and any packing format is decided retrospectively based on the damage endured during transits (mostly by evaluating breakage). A simulation based model would solve this problem, just like any mechanical design, if packaging design can be tested for relative preference. 

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Packaging format for food products need to be designed based on a simulation model. This model should involve a multi body dynamics study to evaluate the maximum forces the final packaged food will be subject to during transit and handling. A simulation has to be done basis forces that products undergo during the journey in the supply chain. 

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a computer simulation model for optimizing packaging design for a given packaged food

4. PROJECT DELIVERABLES:
(a) A comprehensive stimulation model which will help in designing the optimized packaging format.
(b) The simulator should identify and recommend the areas that need to be strengthened for a given load distribution so as to minimize the effects on the product. 
(c) The model has to be made modular taking inputs from different aspects of transit in the supply chain and should be able to be generalized to any product.

17|" INTRODUCTION
India is a country with the second largest road network in the world. Out of the total stretch of 5.4 million km of road network, almost 97,991 km is covered by national highways. Challenges in traffic management and congestion cause huge financial, environmental, and physiological costs to the individual and to the government. On an average, a person spends anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of their day commuting, accounting to almost 520 hours a year. It is estimated that the traffic congestion in the four metro cities costs the nation approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh crore (more than the annual Railway budget for this year) {Reference:1,2}. 

This problem statement focuses on developing a specialized aerial solution for automatic aerial analysis of traffic activity in highways and city roads using Unmanned aerial vehicles. The end goal is to explore new possibilities in the field of traffic analysis by its fully automatic calculation of a wide range of traffic parameters such as speed, densities, time, and pollution levels.

These data can be used for:
o	Betterment of road condition: Detecting potholes and inefficient speed breakers
o	Detecting traffic anomalies: Identifying root cause of traffic and other emergencies
o	Toll-gate efficiency: Prevent choking of traffic at toll gates
o	Maintain strict traffic regulations: Identifying traffic violations
o	Aid in controlling city pollution levels: detecting and publishing noise and air pollution levels

Aerial Monitoring using drones overcome the limitations of traditional methods of traffic data collection due to its mobility, complexity, and ability to cover large areas. Airborne sensors (GPS, FPV cameras, gas sensors etc.) provide sufficient amount of data to enable vehicle location and movement monitoring.

MathWorks tools like the Image Processing, Computer Vision System, Statistics and Machine Learning, Mapping Toolboxes and Hardware Support Packages for drones open door to a variety of applications in these areas {Reference:3-5}.

53|" BRIEF on GOONJ:- its a 19+ years old non-profit organization working on  utilizing discarded urban material as a tool for development. We are a force of 900 people with work spread across 23 states in India. Goonj  has won many National and International awards including the Ramon Magsaysay award 2015 to our founder Anshu Gupta. The work has touched upon some difficult rural development issues like water, sanitation, infrastructure, agriculture, migration apart from sustained work in disaster-hit communities.
Goonj receives tonnes of material annually from urban population.  This material goes through storing, sorting and processing. Sorted material is converted into kits of reusable material. Goonj engages with local communities in far flung areas in rural India to get development work done in their community using their own local resources and manpower. Material packed in kits is used as a parallel currency and is given out as a reward for their efforts. 
Do visit our website www.goonj.org to know more.                         
PROBLEM STATEMENT - IMPACT ASSESSMENT ON ENVIRONMENT :--.  Goonj deals with 3000+ tones (and increasing) of material (trash) annually. Material constitutes of apparel, cloth, kitchen utensils & appliances, electronic items, toys, stationery, books, footwear, furniture and many other household items. Goonj up-cycles the material and uses as parallel currency to get development work done in rural India.
Up-cycling and extending the life of any material saves it from being dumped into landfill.

Devise relevant  analytics to help the authorities realize whether to increase the frequency/passenger capacity of bus/metro in real-time at certain stops could also be included in the system. 
Inputs to the application: 
-	Static Input (doesn’t change frequently)
o	Route names of DTC buses and their stoppage on that route
o	Bus Make (Number of standing/sitting seats)
-	Dynamic Input (changes real-time)
o	For every stop – no. of passengers boarded and de-boarded (Can be inputted by the bus staff) 


Outputs of the application:
Real-time information about the bus  with its seat availability information (number of vacant sitting/standing seats). The application is expected to show the bus going on a static pre-defined route with number of standing/sitting seats.

Future Optimizations:
-	User information like their boarding point and destination can be inputted
-	The number of boarding/deboarding passengers can also be inputted by beacons/RFID tags/thermal measure installed on the bus
-	Destination info about each passenger boarding the bus
o	 so that a bus doesn’t have to stop at every bus stop and a user can determine if the bus will reach their destination in the shortest possible time

64|" Real-time estimation of Heart Rate from facial images under different lighting conditions using Smartphone Camera
Smart phone application that measures heartrate using on-board cameras in real-time and non-invasively offers several advantages and have multiple use cases. Detecting heart rate using only camera has an added advantage because in such case the users do not require any skills or compliance, but has to just capture image/video. During exercise, it is often desired that the user can measure their heart rate without any extra accessory. Wearing a wearable during exercise can be uncomfortable to certain users. Catering to the phenomenon of people using camera as the most popular smartphone feature we can address this problem. 
This work will predominantly focus on estimating Heart Rate in real-time from facial images captured using smartphone camera.  With every Heart Beat blood flows to our face. Whenever our heart circulates blood, the amount of light reflected from the face varies. To the human eye, this variation is invisible. But using image processing techniques we can detect these changes. The underlying principle is to analyse the spatio-temporal variations in the time-series facial images and amplify these variations. The time series of color values at pixels in region of interest is used to estimate the heart rate. For this work data needs to be collected at various lighting conditions: i) Daytime Outdoor (Cloudy and Sunny) ii) Daytime Indoor iii) Night-time Indoor. Data needs to be acquired for resting and exercising condition.

“It is the customer who determines what a business is, what it produces, and whether it will prosper.” The concept of customer centricity is not new, today almost every company vision includes customer centricity as a key driver of its strategy. Companies that adopt this philosophy are 60% more profitable compared to companies that are not focused on the customer.  The world is changing around us, the customer base, technology and the environment. For these reasons, we are more focused than ever at the online web-based after sale services will help us to elevate our business and have better connect with end customer, so that products offered not only have functional value but emotional value too.
Targeting retailers, distributors and competitive customer conversion will aid in accelerate existing market share.
One of the challenge in customer conversion is ease of customer with linked TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. To support end customer understanding the new technologies and make them conversant with the IIOT thru digital way, we need to create a platform where the End Consumer can access the pool of competent and skilled manpower to serve their needs at the time of need with a greater pace.
This platform can be accessed not only by SMSE where they will enjoy the services at shared basis at much nominal cost but will also be accessed by heavy Industries for their complex application and consultancies for their Plant maintenance and services. Lack of customer confidence and invisibility of right support are the predominant reasons of lower efficiency productions in Indian Industries. Unplanned downtime can cost a company as much as 20MINR an hour (according to research).
Indian electrical markets are driven by distributors and retailers. Around 95% of total electrical business is catered by distributors and retailers. They have reach to the remotest of the places, since they do not have the competence of VFD commissioning the do not serve the customers with this product and hence the availability of the product becomes an issue to EU resulting into bigger downtime.
To facilitate these distributors and to serve the EU in time of need Schneider Electric will be first in market to ignite opportunity by setting the world of commissioning in motion. A location based web application that makes an on-demand hiring from pool of certified engineers, electricians or freelance consultants with competency status enables you to grow your business in an efficient way, while conserving your own resources. Certified engineers will adjust the drive parameters to meet the precise demands of the application. This app would leverage our customers to confide in Schneider Electric.

Application is engineer-sharing for fast, reliable commissioning in minutes – day or night. There’s no need to wait, you have to just tap request engineer, and it’s easy to pay with credit card or cash. App based services will be cost effective as it provides nearest solution available in that area, distance plays an important factor in deciding cost for services. Today customer is dependent on channel and on availability of its engineers but with this app, customer will be independent to choose an engineer anytime, wherever he wants. It will be transparent service helping customers to provide a seamless digital service experience. Every service kind will be in the database of Schneider and thus reduce the total cost of ownership of the EU. Access to cloud based data can further be used by customer care to trigger warnings to customer for monthly or annual maintenance and end of product life information, product and systems health reports.
