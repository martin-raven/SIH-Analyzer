      " TITLE: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing for Online Inspection of Packed Cases\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1.BACKGROUND: Leaves of a crop are threshed and are packed into 200 Kg cases. 10% of these packed cases are later inspected for conformity to the master case approved by the customer in terms of Color, Ripeness and Uniformity. The quality inspection processes are manually operated and rely on the judgmental experience of the experts. The judgment is heavily driven by personal, business and environmental factors and is highly subjective.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2.PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Inspection is a crucial activity to ensure customer satisfaction. Although it doesn’t eliminate the defects in the product, it helps identify the defective products before they are dispatched to the customer. The limitations with the existing inspection process is multi-fold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "• While Customer expects all the cases to be inspected, due to space and man-power constraints, today, the business is able to achieve only 10% inspection. \r\n",
      "• As the inspection process happens one day after the cases are processed, due to limitations with Expert availability, real-time corrective actions in the factory in case of deviations in product quality gets difficult\r\n",
      "• Due to human involvement in the visual inspection, there is inherent subjectivity involved in the process\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. PROBLEM STATEMENT: To automate in real-time, the packed case inspection using Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques and enhancing the objectivity of the inspection process. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "1. BACKGROUND: The packaging format design is currently based on trial and error for most of the packaged food products. The packaging format decides the damage any food product will undergo, especially during transit and handling. Especially for biscuits, product breakage is a prime concern, and any packing format is decided retrospectively based on the damage endured during transits (mostly by evaluating breakage). A simulation based model would solve this problem, just like any mechanical design, if packaging design can be tested for relative preference. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Packaging format for food products need to be designed based on a simulation model. This model should involve a multi body dynamics study to evaluate the maximum forces the final packaged food will be subject to during transit and handling. A simulation has to be done basis forces that products undergo during the journey in the supply chain. \r\n",

      "3. PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a computer simulation model for optimizing packaging design for a given packaged food\r\n",

      "4. PROJECT DELIVERABLES:\r\n",
      "(a) A comprehensive stimulation model which will help in designing the optimized packaging format.\r\n",
      "(b) The simulator should identify and recommend the areas that need to be strengthened for a given load distribution so as to minimize the effects on the product. \r\n",
      "(c) The model has to be made modular taking inputs from different aspects of transit in the supply chain and should be able to be generalized to any product. \r\n",

      " INTRODUCTION\r\n",
      "India is a country with the second largest road network in the world. Out of the total stretch of 5.4 million km of road network, almost 97,991 km is covered by national highways. Challenges in traffic management and congestion cause huge financial, environmental, and physiological costs to the individual and to the government. On an average, a person spends anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of their day commuting, accounting to almost 520 hours a year. It is estimated that the traffic congestion in the four metro cities costs the nation approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh crore (more than the annual Railway budget for this year) {Reference:1,2}. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This problem statement focuses on developing a specialized aerial solution for automatic aerial analysis of traffic activity in highways and city roads using Unmanned aerial vehicles. The end goal is to explore new possibilities in the field of traffic analysis by its fully automatic calculation of a wide range of traffic parameters such as speed, densities, time, and pollution levels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These data can be used for:\r\n",
      "o\tBetterment of road condition: Detecting potholes and inefficient speed breakers\r\n",
      "o\tDetecting traffic anomalies: Identifying root cause of traffic and other emergencies\r\n",
