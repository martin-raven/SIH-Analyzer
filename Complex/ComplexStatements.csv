8|" TITLE: ""Drone Doctors: Deep Learning of plant topography for predictive / prescriptive analysis against pest and diseases"".

BACKGROUND: Crop losses owing to pest & diseases are inherent in Indian agriculture with the annual loss of 15-25% of productivity. Pest & diseases are complex, crop/region specific, seasonal, epidemic/endemic, which require integrated approaches to manage the loss. Due to the level of complexity, diagnosis for preventive measures are challenging, particularly our inability to (fore)see the pest/disease occurrence and their life cycle, while the level of difficulty raises with the size of land holdings. Due to the poor visibility of pest and disease occurrences, our ability to integrate and use the data for preventive/prescriptive measures has been the challenge leading to continuous productivity loss.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Crop loss is generally diagnosed by the symptoms developed by pest and diseases, while manual diagnosis has a very limited scope in identifying the damaged plant parts, while recognizing the pattern of pest/disease distribution almost close to impossible in large area. Drone based scanning the large area using both visible and near-infrared light, could help track changes in plants at large scale and identify the distribution pattern very precisely. Further, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven software could process the images; integrate the existing knowledge and develop the solutions in real-time. In addition, such approach could also open the scope of predictive analysis to execute automate alert to the farmers, potentially improve the crop productivity to more than 20%.

PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a custom drone and integrated software with AI for predictive/prescriptive model against pest and diseases in crop plants.

The proposed requirements are as follows,
A: HARDWARE
1. Drone integrated with IR lenses
2. Communication device for data transmission to cloud

B. SOFTWARE
1. “Intelligent” Software that process the digital images; extract the binaries; categorize them to diagonise the biotic stress; integrate with existing knowledge; execute the predictive / prescriptive analysis and generate alerts for communication.
2. Cloud environment with management dashboard

PROJECT DELIVERABLES:
1. An aerial survey and data collection system, fully functional with visible and IR lenses. 
2. Managed communication of the images/data to the cloud.
3. AI driven Software – fully functional for predictive and prescriptive analytics
4. Alert system for users (including farmers) in various formats including RSS feeds (for news channels) and mobile applications.

62|" Background:
Non-communicable disease continues to be an important public health problem in India, being responsible for a major proportion of mortality and morbidity. Demographic changes, changes in the lifestyle along with increased rates of urbanization are the major reasons responsible for the tilt towards the non-communicable diseases. In India, there is no regular system for collecting data on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which can be said to be of adequate coverage or quality. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481705/
 
While disease burden surveys from the likes of ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) do provide directional insights, bottom-up data is certainly more effective in making focused interventions.
 
For instance, focused on cardio-vascular and diabetes, identification of prevalence and micro-segments of population at risk is critical to deliver care as these require specialist interventions, not easily available in the rural markets. These conditions also require the patients to be on long term care in terms of continuous parameter evaluation and management of the vital parameters. Better understanding of prevalence through early diagnosis and focused geographical/demographical views help deploy the sparse resources effectively – both by the public and private health institutions.               
Objective: How can a combination of UIDAI/Aadhaar, “Low fidelity high frequency” medical devices that can capture recurring diagnostic data at a high frequency come together to enable better data collection? How can advanced data analytics (ML/DL/AI) on top of this data platform help improve 10x, the diagnosis and intervention touch points for non-communicable diseases (NCD) focused on Cardio-Vascular and Diabetes, primarily in Rural/Semi-Urban environments?Guidance:
•             Solution should have measurable key performance indicators (KPI)
•             KPI should be clearly linked to the goal of improving the early diagnosis of these conditions as well as enable planners give access to the distribution of patient population
•             Note: Solution proposed should enable identification of patients to ensure the attributability and accuracy of the data but respect the data privacy of the patients
•             You might want to narrow down the problem into sub parts or address all separately. You can address one or more of the following  :
•             Identify the diagnostic approach for common causes of diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases
•             Identify various common use-case data capture environments and leverage that to build data sets
•             ML/DL models that can creatively leverage varied data sets of demographics, climate, other conditions to progressively improve the diagnosis as well as disease distribution prediction
•             At least one example of the journey should be included in the solution where you provide the details of how your solution will operate/ change a day in life of a patient or a care-professional/planner

63|" Background:
Indian market for pharmaceuticals is predominantly branded generics. Doctors write the brand name of the drug rather than the active ingredient name. (Eg. NISE instead of Nimesulide, or Crocin instead of Paracetamol). Apart from OTC (Over the Counter Drugs) a health care practitioner (Doctor) can only prescribe a medicine. Hence the end consumer is not the decision maker.
To increase revenue all the pharmaceutical companies strive to get mind share of the doctor so that for a particular drug their brand is at the top of the evoked set. It is against the law to provide any direct inducement to the doctor to prescribe a certain brand.
Hence, pharmaceutical companies send Medical Representatives (MR) to the doctor frequently to ensure the doctor is reminded of the brand / Brand Recall. Medical representatives also provide information to the doctors on new product launch, new packaging or other information about the brand. They also inform the doctor about the brand availability at the local pharmacy stores. There are multiple theories on why a doctor prescribes a certain brand. One theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because they trust the quality. Another theory is that they have a certain evoked set of brands and divides the prescriptions arbitrarily based on the brand that comes to their mind. Another theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because of personal working relationship or even in some cases out of sympathy due to general longer waiting time of MRs to meet him/her.
Medical representative gets very small share of the doctor's time. Usually the interaction lasts from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Medical representatives have to spend a lot of time waiting for the doctor's time or travelling from one clinic/hospital to another. Pharma companies have to employ a huge force of Medical Representatives to ensure reach to doctors. However, this is very expensive to scale up.
 
Objective:
To enable 10 X growth in prescriptions with digital technology as an enabler
 
Guidance:
•             Solution should have measurable key performance indicators (KPI)
•             KPI should be clearly linked to the goal of generating prescriptions.
•             Solution should be scalable
•             No part of Solution should include any direct inducement to the doctor (Eg. Commission or direct material favours)
•             You might want to narrow down the problem into sub parts or address all separately. You can address one or more of the following  :
•             Increasing the effectiveness of the Interaction between doctor and MR
•             Enabling the same MR team to reach more doctors
•             Enable reach to doctors without MR through digital means (Doctors not getting covered by MR visits)
•             At least one example of the experience journey should be provided in the solution where you provide the details of how your solution will change a day in life of the Doctor and a MR etc
•             The 10 X growth is kept as a framework so that that you don’t provide an incremental solution which cannot be scaled."|Dr Reddy's Labs|1.0|Healthcare & Biomedical Devices|Complex
64|" Power Transformer is an important and vital equipment for Power Supply System in a transmission grid. It’s back -down leads to commercial losses and inconvenience to the public.

•	Today, we have a vast transmission network with lakhs of power transformer in the grid. The Power transformer fleet is maintained by each state utility in its domain. The failure rate of transformer has been a matter of concern and it is attributable mainly to the maintenance of the transformer.

•	There are good practices of maintenance- both preventive and predictive. 

Predictive maintenance has gone far ahead in terms of knowledge and technology today in the area of power transformer and we have condition monitoring equipment, both off-line and on-line.

•	It is proved over a period of time that these condition monitoring predictive maintenance has saved million of Rupees for utility and successfully provided uninterrupted power supply.

•	Inspite of having advance off-line and on-line condition monitoring, it is quite challenging for utility to precisely look at each and every transformer. In a way, it is manual assessment. Utility is like to miss the right time intervention to take corrective action based on condition monitoring data recorded in the off-line and on-line monitoring equipment.

With above background, following software is required:-

Like a health check in human being on regular basis, one can know the health parameters and recommend the required medicine and remedial actions to overcome the development and worsening of health. The similar concept is proposed for power transformer fleet. The recorded off-line and on-line condition monitoring parameters will be the base to work-out the health index of each transformer. It will be done by assigning a grade depending on the impact of each condition monitoring parameters. The final health index value of each transformer has to be worked out based on all conditions monitoring attributes. We need to develop a software which will have transformer fleet data base and give a health index of each transformer based on off-line and on-line condition monitoring attributes fed to the software on regular basis.

Benefits: 1) Utility will be able to predict the pre-matured failure of transformer and take corrective action
2) Plan predictive maintenance investment based on health index of each transformer.
3) In totality, it will ensure uninterrupted power supply and save millions of Rupees against replacement of failed transformers."|SkipperSeil|0.0|Software - Mobile App development|Complex
65|" Traditional (conventional) sources of power generation are Thermal (Coal), Hydro, Gas and Nuclear, but they are depleting and causing carbon emission. Many countries are taking harsh decision to close down thermal and nuclear. An alternative source, catching the attention of everyone is renewable energy from Solar and wind, which require no fuel and abundantly available according to geographical location.
However, it has its own characteristic and throw upon challenges to integrate into transmission and distribution grid. 
Solar Energy
1. Solar Energy is available only during daytime and quantum of power varies according to time in bell shape form. This bell shape will change according to season.
2. Solar Energy is variable in the cloudy weather conditions.
Wind Energy
1. Though available throughout the year. Wind potential varies location to location (that’s why installed in specific areas mostly in remote locations) and season to season.
2. Wind is variable, intermittent and unpredictable during 24 hrs. of the day.
Location wise wind potential makes the task of transmission and distribution utility/grid operation more difficult in absence of local consumption as well as adequate network.
Wind Energy is at peak during monsoon. This is the season when power demand is low. Grid operation has a challenge of handling the excess renewal energy. Grid operation is planned day ahead by taking supply (generator) and demand (utility) commitment. Grid operator is bound to control supply-demand balance to maintain frequency, but it becomes challenging when wind energy is accounted as part of supply in the day ahead planning due to variable and intermittent nature of wind. Grid operator is compelled to back-down conventional sources of generation to minimum level (inefficient operation) for load balancing.
With above background of renewable energy generation, there is need of software solution/modes in the hands of grid operator to predict solar and wind energy generation day ahead as well as during grid operation on hourly basis to guide them for load management.
Benefits: Right solar and wind energy prediction model will enable grid operator to plan dispatches and manage load balancing and efficient operation of power plant."|SkipperSeil|1.0|Software - Mobile App development|Complex

Goal: Reduce carbon footprint of the travel
Proposal: Build a smartphone app that helps you to car/bike pool, compare and compete with your friends on the carbon footprint of the travel.
Air pollution in India is a serious issue with major contributors being vehicle emissions and traffic congestions. Individuals and communities can play a more effective role in reducing the air pollution if they are aware of their contributions to the same. Carbon footprint is one way of quantifying the direct and indirect emissions.

Basic guidelines of the app: 
1.	Community centred – the app lets you invite family and friends to join a community that strives to reduce the carbon footprint
2.	Gamification – Virtual points/badges awarded to the members who top the eco-friendliness of commute, or make significant improvements to their carbon footprint
3.	Simple to use – the app may request the user to setup their regular mode of travel (private vehicle or public transport) during the onboarding time. The app infers other details of the commute automatically through smartphone sensors (GPS etc.) and related framework, for e.g., Android’s DetectedActivity class.

111|" Presently, the slot allocation process allocates departure slot at an airport. The airline then requests an arrival slot after due consideration of flying time, taxi out time & taxi in time at the destination airport. If the arrival slot is not available, the next available arrival slot is allotted, Based on slot availability, airport may allocate early slot resulting in shortfall in block time, thereby adding an artificial “balloon” to the total flight time. 
Slot allocation is done with respect to Gate out Time and Gate in Time for the respective City pair. The variable factors as shown in the last row are adjusted accordingly to meet the requirements of Gate out Time and Gate in Time (Total Block Time).  However, the extra padding or buffer time which the airlines add, is based on historic data and not realistic. The airlines would accept the non-corresponding slot times (with their blocks) to allow the flights to be operated. The DGCA also allowed a 10 minute plus/minus window from the standard block time which creates additional variability. Major feature to include:
i.	Air traffic congestion and Delays to flights due to early arriving flights 
ii.	Incorrect or inflated Block times
iii  	Early departures from origin Airports
iv 	Airlines accepting incorrect arrival slots at congested airports
v 	Absence of Penal action for non-adherence of slots
vi 	Seeking for an innovative solution
The airlines will need to be engaged to disclose the optimal block time for each scheduled operation. Once the current data is obtained, the slot schedule needs to be “gamed” via slot swaps where possible and adjustments where necessary to develop an optimal slot schedule. Additional constraints that need to be considered include airline marketing/competitive issues and arrival/departure slot constraints at each airport. As stated above, the desired outcome is an optimized schedule that achieves the desired performance parameters and rationalize the timings."|Min. of Civil Aviation|0.0|Software - Web App development|Complex

113| Insect Pest take a heavy toll on agricultural crops causing severe loss to the farming community. Crop protection is one of the major component of crop management process. Crops are damaged by attack of disease, insect, nematodes and weeds. Managing them in the field and saving the crop from their attack is a major challenge for the farming community. Our crops are under threat from the day they are seeded til they are harvested causing significant damage to the crop affecting adversely to the farmer's economy. Many factors influence disease development and growth of insect that includes genetics of variety, plant growth stage, weather, soil etc. Most of these information on insects, disease etc has been identified and documented by the Scientists of National Agricultural Research System (ICAR). This documentation will have a better significance if they are reached out to the farming community whenever they need it. Developing a web or mobile app having a complete knowledge base of insect pest carrying its detail  in the background will be of great help. It will help  in identifying the insect pest in the farmers field based on the damaged symptom or by the image of the insects.

However due to inadequate logistic support, lack of  refrigerated storage, supply chain bottle necks, poor transport, and underdeveloped marketing channels around 30 percent of the produce is lost falling heavily on the economy of the farming community including woman farmers. Information on crop specific market, prevailing price and minimum transaction cost may be the solution of the problem. Seeing the capacity and reach out potential of web or mobile based application may be of great help. Applying ICT based technical interventions in developing Web/Mobile applications for identifying crop specific market, prevailing price, information on storage facilities,value additions, transportation may help in reducing post harvest losses and adding to improve farmers economy.

115| Rice is the most important crop in India. It is widely cultivated in diverse ecologies and agro ecological zones. Management levels and production constraints vary spatially and temporally in these environments. Therefore crop/location specific management practices are needed to increase  productivity of Rice crop. The traditional way of collecting precise information by sampling from fields requires lots of manpower and time. As spatial variations in land, soil, water, weather etc. are influencing the productivity of  Rice crop, the modern space technologies can appropriately be utilized to derive the precise information in shorter time. Many GIS softwares like ARCGIS, ERDAS Imagine, QGIS etc are available for analysing the spatial data. These spatial files can be utilised further to integrate with other simulation models  or  visualise  these spatial variations to end users. Hence, development of geo referenced map interface is needed to visualise the map along with attribute data and attributes wise classification of the data. Once developed, this interface can be utilised  for any other crops/cropping systems.|ICAR, Min. of Agriculture|1.0|Software - Web App development|Complex
